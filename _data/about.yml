- I'm a senior year undergraduate student at Waseda University, majoring in Electrical Engineering, Biology and Computer Science. My research interest is on Machine Learning, especially Baysian methods and Neural Networks. 
- Currently, I'm working on DNA sequencing problem using Baysian Nonparametric methods supervised by [Prof. Michiaki Hamada](https://sites.google.com/site/michiakihamada/), as an undergraduate research assistant . Also, I've been working on Neural Networks with [Prof. Pierre Baldi](http://www.igb.uci.edu/~pfbaldi/), during my exchange program at University of California, Irvine.
