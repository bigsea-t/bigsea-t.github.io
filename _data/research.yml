    # - Implemented state-of-the-art nonparametric HMM model called FABHMM ([Fujimaki et. al. ICML 2012](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/fujimaki_ICML12.pdf)) in Pyhon and Cython.
    # - Software is available on [github](https://github.com/bigsea-t/hmmlearn/tree/fabhmm), which inherit basic features from OSS [hmmlearn](https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn).
